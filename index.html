<p>On 2011 line devices, you have to be in MSC mode instead of MTP mode. Here is how to switch to MSC mode :

<p>Plugins will appear in the plugin menu if and only if all plugin requirements are met.
<br>Here are requirements for BL Unlock plugin :
<li>kernelversions=2.6.29,2.6.29-00054-g5f01537
<li>androidversions=2.1,2.2,2.3
<li>needroot=true
<li>compatibledevices=X10,E10,E15,U20
<p> If at least one of these criteria is not met, plugin will not be added to the Plugins menu

<p>Well, the flash button will ALWAYS be available. If your device is not recognized, Flashing will be the only feature available.
<br>It means you can flash FTF bundles made for your device and upgrade / downgrade your device.
